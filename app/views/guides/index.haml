        What & Why

      %p This page is an introduction on what Mint is.

      %h2
        What Is Mint?

      %p
        Mint is a language specifically created for writing

        = succeed "." do
          %b single page applications

        It is basically compiler and a framework combined to provide great
        developer exprience while allowing to write safe, readable and
        maintainable code.

      %p
        It was born out of the frustration of the JavaScript language and
        ecosystem (NPM) and the Elm language and it's not so open
        development pratices.

      %h3
        What is wrong with JavaScript?

      %p
        JavaScript is not a strongly typed language which makes it difficult to
        write error free web applications in and leads to a not so great developer
        experience. Also it does not have the tools to build web applications
        in out of the box, you need frameworks and compilers and build tools
        which increases complexity.

      %h3
        What is wrong with Elm?

      %p
        Elm has great developer experience, but it being purely functional
        language leads to some boilerplate code and makes it harder to learn.
        Also it's not possible to contribute or influence the language in any
        meaningful way.

      %h2
        Why Mint?

      %p
        Mint aims to combine the developer expreience of Elm and the
        expressiveness of React to create the perfect lanugage for building
        single page applciations.
