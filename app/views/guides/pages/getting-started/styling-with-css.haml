%h1 Styling with CSS

%p
  After you have something on the screen you probably want to add some styles to
  it. This is easy to do in Mint, you can even do it with simple CSS!

%p
  In components, styles can be defined with an identifier, then applied to HTML
  using the identifier as a CSS class. A style can contain any number of CSS
  definitions, sub rules, media queries,
  %code if
  and
  %code case
  statements.

%p.hint.hint--info
  = octicon "info"
  %span
    A style is scoped to the component it's defined in.

%p
  This is how it looks when we style the component what we just created:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      component Main {
        style button {
          background: red;
          color: white;
          border: 0;
        }

        fun render : Html {
          <button::button>
            "Click ME!"
          </button>
        }
      }

%p
  The button is now red with white text.
